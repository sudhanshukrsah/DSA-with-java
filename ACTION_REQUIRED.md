The following pull requests need to be **manually closed** by the repository owner:

### PR #1: "Implement Daily Java Streak Automation System for GitHub"
- **Status**: Open (Draft)

## How to Close PRs

1. Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/sudhanshukrsah/DSA-with-java
2. Navigate to "Pull requests" tab
3. For PR #1:
   - Click on the PR
   - Click "Close pull request" button
   - Add comment: "Cancelled - switching to manual learning approach"
4. For PR #2 (this PR):
   - Review the changes made
   - Merge if satisfied with the changes
   - This will automatically close the PR

## Why Manual Closure is Required

Due to security restrictions, automated tools cannot:
- Close pull requests
- Modify PR descriptions
- Update issue statuses
- Push to other branches

These actions require human review and approval for security reasons.

## Next Steps After Closing PRs

1. The repository will use the manual learning approach
2. Follow the guide in MANUAL_PRACTICE.md for structured learning
3. Create new Java programs manually when you want to practice
4. Commit your progress at your own pace
