# DSA with Java - Manual Learning Journey

This repository contains Java programming exercises focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It's designed for manual practice and learning without automation.

## File Structure

```

## About This Repository

This is a simple Java learning repository for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms concepts. Each folder represents a day of learning with focused topics.

## How to Practice

1. **Choose a topic** you want to practice (variables, loops, arrays, etc.)
2. **Create a new folder** for your practice session:
   ```bash
   mkdir java-dayN
   mkdir java-dayN/src
   ```
3. **Write your Java program**:
   ```bash
   cd java-dayN/src
   # Create Main.java with your code
   ```
4. **Test your code**:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
5. **Commit your work** when ready:
   ```bash
   git add java-dayN
   git commit -m "Add Day N: Your Topic"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Learning Topics

Practice these fundamental Java and DSA concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types** - Understanding Java data types
- **Conditional Statements** - if-else, switch statements  
- **Loops** - for, while, do-while loops
- **Arrays** - Array operations and basic algorithms
- **Methods** - Functions, recursion, parameters
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, objects, inheritance
- **Data Structures** - Lists, stacks, queues, trees
- **Algorithms** - Sorting, searching, recursion

## Example Program Structure

Create programs following this structure:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your learning topic here
        System.out.println("Learning Java and DSA!");
        
        // Add your practice code
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- **Java JDK 8 or higher**
- **Git** for version control
- **Text editor or IDE** (VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sudhanshukrsah/DSA-with-java.git
   cd DSA-with-java
   ```

2. **Practice existing code**:
   ```bash
   cd java-day3/src
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

3. **Start your own practice**:
   - Create new folders for your learning sessions
   - Write code to practice specific concepts  
   - Test and refine your programs
   - Commit your progress

## Benefits of Manual Practice

âœ… **Intentional Learning** - Focus on understanding concepts  
âœ… **Flexible Pace** - Learn at your own speed  
âœ… **Deep Understanding** - Type every line, understand every concept  
âœ… **Problem Solving** - Debug and fix issues yourself  
âœ… **Custom Topics** - Choose what you want to learn
